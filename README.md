<h3>Intro</h3>
This is my first ever "serious" program, even before I started my BSc. <br>Under those circumstances the code doesn't repsresnt my current abilities, nevertheless I decided to show off becuase it's really a lot of code which requires lots of thinking.
After all the game works fine except for some bugs here and there and you can see by playing the game the effort that I put in. 
<br>
I used LibGDX framework as game development platform.
<h3>Demo</h3>
