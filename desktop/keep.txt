	/*
	 * What to do:
	 * When calculating the ratio take a little bit lower dimensions because it can be wrong by a pixel.
	 * And it looks like one border is missing.
	 * 
	 * Scan for each level the smallest image possible that includes the borders.
	 * Calculate where to put it then decrease from the number the initial coords like here 3350 and 1399.
	 * 
	 * Transform helis pos to ones adequate for the toScan image but before comparing decrease x and y ToCen
	 * Maybe make a new image of the fence with smaller ones.
